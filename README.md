# TheSocialWeb
Final application developed for the course the social web

For the application to work, you need the folder FlaskApp. 

Two types of applications:

Run the read_database.py to see the visualizations on the dataset we retrieved on our own

Run the app.py to enter queries yourself and to see the visualizations.

After running those (those are the server) go to localhost:5000 to view the page
